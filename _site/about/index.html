 <p>Hello, I’m Waut Lornoy - a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for technology. As a student at Howest, I’m excited to share my journey through college and into the field of cybersecurity on this blog. <br />
Here, you’ll find hands-on experiences, in-depth project breakdowns, and my personal perspective on what it’s like to navigate the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity. From tackling challenging coursework to gaining practical experience through internships and job roles, I aim to provide a comprehensive look at the industry - with insights that are both informative and engaging.
 <h1 id="my-journey">My journey</h1>
 <p>I was first introduced to the world of cybersecurity at just ten years old, after falling victim to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack while playing an online game. Instead of being intimidated, I was fascinated by the concept and eager to learn more about hacking and technology. This incident sparked a curiosity that would eventually become a lifelong passion. <br />
As I entered high school, I gained the freedom to pursue my interests in STEM subjects, which allowed me to delve deeper into the world of cybersecurity and IT. Through online tutorials, blog posts, and other resources, I spent countless hours learning and expanding my knowledge in this field. It was during this time that I stumbled upon <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a>, a platform that provided me with a solid foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals. <br />
Around the same time, I also discovered <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/">Darknet Diaries</a>, a podcast that shared real-life stories of individuals working in the cybersecurity industry, including those who used their skills for malicious purposes. This exposure not only broadened my understanding of the field but also helped me set clear goals for my future career. My vision is now set on becoming a respected cybersecurity professional and using my skills to help people protect themselves against the ever-growing threats that exist online.
