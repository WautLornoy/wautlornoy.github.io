# Friday, April 18th
Thomas and Jeff kicked off their adventure with a late flight, landing in Gothenburg around 22:00. Despite a small delay, the flight was comfortable. They were fortunate to stay at Jeff’s niece's apartment for the next two nights. She welcomed them warmly, sharing insights about Swedish culture, including recycling practices and local tips.

# Saturday, April 19th
After a late start, Thomas and Jeff ventured out to explore Gothenburg. They discovered charming shops and indulged in a traditional shrimp sandwich, albeit at a steep price. Their day was filled with walking—33,000 steps, to be exact! They capped it off with a hurried dinner of spaghetti bolognese.

Thomas and Jeff woke up even later than before. They visited the maritime museum, where they were pleasantly surprised by the exhibits. Jeff introduced Thomas to Fika, a delightful Swedish coffee break, and they enjoyed local pastries. In the evening, they prepared homemade Swedish meatballs for dinner.
Meanwhile, my journey began late at night when Victor and Jurre picked me up in Bruges around 23:00. We set off on a road trip, first picking up Gianni near Ghent.

# Monday, April 21st
As night fell, Victor, Gianni, Jurre, and I drove through the Netherlands and into Germany, making a quick stop at a McDonald's to refuel and stretch our legs. We took advantage of the autobahn's lack of speed limits, reaching a thrilling 180 km/h before slowing down due to fuel consumption concerns.
After crossing into Denmark, we stopped again to get our bearins before heading to Malmö. We encountered border control around 10:00 but were allowed to continue without issues. Upon reaching Gothenburg around 14:30, we met up with Aaron, Andy, and Lukas at an Irish pub, where we talked and walked around the city.
Meanwhile, Thomas and Jeff planned to catch a train to Skövde at 16:00. However, they lost track of time at the Hard Rock Café and missed their first train. This is where we stumbled upon them as they were catching a bus to the station. Thomas and Jeff arrived in Skövde around 18:00, where Oscar had already picked up the keys to their Airbnb. They enjoyed dinner at Bastard Burgers. In the meantime Jurre, Victor, and I continued driving towards Skövde, arriving at our hotel around 18:00, just in time for dinner and some much-needed rest.
