In this [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/billing) writeup we will use metasploit to execute code on a Linux machine and then escelate our privileges to gain root access.

# Reconaissance
First I did an nmap scan of the server and discovered 4 open ports. One of these ports is an Apache webserver with the title "MagnusBilling".

Upon opening the website we are greeted with a login page, so I decided to dig through the javascript to see if I could find a version number. Then I stumbled upon a comment from 2023, so I looked up "MagnusBilling 2023 exploit and the first result was an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability from [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258/).

# Exploitation
So I decided to open up metasploit and run the exploit. After setting the options I gained a shell!

So I checked out the home directory and found the user "Magnus", in this directory I found the first flag under "user.txt". Now all that's left is gaining root access.

# Post Exploitation
First I checked out all SUID binaries with ``find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null``, but I did not find any vulnerable binaries. So I checked out what I can do with sudo using ``sudo -l`` here I got the following output: ``(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client``. I searched for a way to execute commands using this binary and found I can define actions when an IP should be banned. So I decided to define a new evil action that sets the setuid bit on /bin/bash to then gain a root shell.
