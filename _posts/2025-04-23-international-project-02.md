description: >
  In this post, we recount the second day of our international project, where we faced new challenges at the university. A particularly tricky task involving a YouTube video of ducks led to a humorous misunderstanding for our team. After navigating the day's challenges, we capped off the evening with drinks at the student bar.

As the excitement of our international project continues, we dove into the second day filled with new challenges and unexpected twists. With our team eager to tackle the tasks ahead, we arrived at the university bright and early, ready to see what the day had in store for us.

It was the second day of the project, and we were back at the university by 9:00 to receive new challenges. We dove right into the tasks, with older challenges carrying higher scores due to their increased difficulty. One particular challenge really threw our team for a loop. The first image featured Darth Vader pointing at a pipe, accompanied by some strange gibberish. I quickly figured out it was a [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKZqyRlgEP4), which led to a video of ducks waddling around campus, speaking in… duck.

We mistakenly thought we had to physically visit every location the ducks appeared in the video. Thomas and I went to the last location shown, which had a banner, but we found nothing. Disappointed, we asked the professors for help, only to learn that it wasn’t an IRL challenge at all. It turns out we just needed to enable subtitles on the video and set the language to Klingon. The key was literally being spoken!

But during our walk around campus we found an old-school arcade which was awesome!

In the afternoon we also received a lecture about IPv6 from Nico Declerck which was interesting.

In the evening, another event was scheduled for us: a chance to grab some drinks at the student bar.
