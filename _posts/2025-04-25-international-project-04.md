  In this post, we summarize the final day of our international project, where we secured 2nd place in the last round of challenges. With Thomas, Jef, Oscar, and Nika checking out for their flight, we raced to complete our tasks. After the winners were announced, Victor, Jurre, and I enjoyed a fun evening at a nearby pub with our teacher Nico, reflecting on our experiences.

As our international project comes to a close, the final day brings a mix of excitement and nostalgia. With the competition heating up, we gathered for one last round of challenges before heading home.

Just like the other days, we had to be on campus by 9:00. Thomas, Jef, Oscar, and Nika needed to check out of their Airbnb to catch their flight on Saturday morning. With a limited time window before submissions closed at 10:00, we focused on solving as many challenges as possible and ended up in 2nd place! While I’m not sure how the other teams fared, it was a fun experience overall. You can see the scores of each team on this scoreboard:

After the challenges concluded, we returned to the auditorium for the announcement of the winners. The challenges were explained, and we all learned a few extra insights. At 15:00, we split up to continue our journeys home, as many from our school were either heading to their hotels or already on their way back. Here we also had to return the badge we received to gain access to the class rooms

Victor, Jurre, and I returned to the hotel and decided to revisit the Kappa Bar, where we had so much fun the previous day. But first, we needed to grab dinner. On our way to the Kappa Bar, we ran into our teacher, Nico, who joined us. However, when we arrived at the Kappa Bar, it was packed, so we opted for a nearby pub instead. We had a great night chatting about various topics with Nico.
