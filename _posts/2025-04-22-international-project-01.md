Today, we were expected at the campus by 9:00, where we met our teachers, Nico Declerck and Jill Vandendriessche. In the auditorium, we received a briefing about the upcoming week, which will be a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge. During this week, we will compete in groups against each other.

We also learned about after-school activities, which include visiting a gaming bar, going out to a student bar, and exploring an art museum. After the briefing, we gathered in our groups and found a comfortable spot in the room to begin our work. We chatted briefly with the Swedish students before diving into the CTF challenges, which included a variety of tasks such as IRL puzzles, games, math problems, forensics, reverse engineering, and more.

At noon, we took a short break to grab some food and coffee in the cafeteria before continuing our search for flags. We worked until 16:30, at which point we wrapped up for the day. Our group split up, with Thomas and his friends heading out for burgers, while Victor, Jurre, and I returned to the hotel for dinner.
