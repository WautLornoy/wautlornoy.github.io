As we embark on our international project, excitement fills the air! Today marks the beginning of a week-long adventure at the campus in Skövde, Sweden, where we will engage in a thrilling Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge. With our teachers guiding us and a variety of activities planned, we are ready to dive into a week of teamwork, learning, and fun. Join us as we share our experiences and the memorable moments that await us!

Today, we were expected at the campus by 9:00, where we met our teachers, Nico Declerck and Jill Vandendriessche. In the auditorium, we received a briefing about the upcoming week, which will be a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge. During this week, we will compete in groups against each other.

We also learned about after-school activities, which include visiting a gaming bar, going out to a student bar, and exploring an art museum. After the briefing, we gathered in our groups and found a comfortable spot in the room to begin our work. We chatted briefly with the Swedish students before diving into the CTF challenges, which included a variety of tasks such as IRL puzzles, games, math problems, forensics, reverse engineering, and more.

At noon, we took a short break to grab some food and coffee in the cafeteria before continuing our search for flags. We worked until 16:30, at which point we wrapped up for the day. Our group split up, with Thomas and his friends heading out for burgers, while Victor, Jurre, and I returned to the hotel for dinner.

In the evening, we had a planned activity at KappaBar, a venue in the center of Skövde where we could enjoy drinks and play games with friends. We had a fantastic time playing a variety of games, including Mario Kart, Mario Party, Call of Duty, Gang Beasts, and more.
