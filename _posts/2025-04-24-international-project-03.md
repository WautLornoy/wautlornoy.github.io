  In this post, we share the events of the third day of our international project, where we returned to campus to face new challenges. As competition intensified, we lost our first place to another group that solved two high-scoring challenges. While Thomas stayed on campus to work on tasks, I returned to the hotel. The day concluded with an organized museum tour, attended by some group members who captured memorable photos.

As our international project progresses, the competition heats up! On the third day, we returned to campus, ready to tackle new challenges and defend our lead.

Just like the day before, we had to be on campus by 9:00. We received more challenges, and similar to yesterday, unsolved challenges offered higher points. Unfortunately, we lost our first place as another group worked relentlessly to catch up, solving two challenges that had a combined score of 2,000 points. Determined to regain our lead, we focused on tackling these challenges.

Meanwhile, other teams began to catch up as hints were provided. Thomas stayed on campus for a meeting and to complete challenges, while I returned to the hotel. An after-school activity was organized—a tour of a local museum. Although I didn’t attend, other group members went and captured some great pictures.
